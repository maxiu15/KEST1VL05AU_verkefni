Practice: Users and Groups

1. Create the users Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Justine Henin, all of them
with password set to stargate, with username (lower case!) as their first name, and
their full name in the comment. Verify that the users and their home directory are
properly created.

useradd -m Serena Williams
passwd Serena Williams serena
useradd -m Venus Williams
passwd Venus Williams venus
useradd -m Justine Henin
passwd Justine Henin justine

ls /etc/passwd


2. Create a user called kornuser, give him the Korn shell (/bin/ksh) as his default
shell. Log on with this user (on a command line or in a tty).

useradd -m /bin/ksh Korn
passwd Korn
su - Korn

3. Create a user named einstime without home directory, give him /bin/date as his
default logon shell. What happens when you log on with this user ? Can you think of
a useful real world example for changing a user's login shell to an application ?

useradd -m /bin/date einstime
passwd einstime

su - einstime

4. Try the commands who, whoami, who am i, w, id, echo $USER $UID .
who ; who am i ; w ; id ; echo $USER $SUID

5a. Lock the venus user account with usermod.
usermod -L Venus WIlliams

5b. Use passwd -d to disable the serena password. Verify the serena line in /etc/
shadow before and after disabling.
ls /etc/shadow
passwd -d Serena Williams
ls /etc/shadow

5c. What is the difference between locking a user account and disabling a user
account's password ? You can get it back if you locked it but if you disabled it you cant.

6. As root change the password of einstime to stargate.
su â€“ root
passwd einstime

7. Now try changing the password of serena to serena as serena.
Wont work


8. Make sure every new user needs to change his password every 10 days.

9. Set the warning number of days to four for the kornuser.
chage -W 4 kornuser


10a. Set the password of two separate users to stargate. Look at the encrypted
stargate's in /etc/shadow and explain.
If you used passwd, then the salt will be different for the two encrypted passwords.

10b. Take a backup as root of /etc/shadow. Use vi to copy an encrypted stargate to
another user. Can this other user now log on with stargate as a password ? yes

11. Put a file in the skeleton directory and check whether it is copied to user's home
directory. When is the skeleton directory copied ?
When you create a user account with a new home directory.


12. Why use vipw instead of vi ? What could be the problem when using vi or vim ?

vipw will give a warning when someone else is already using
that file

13. Use chsh to list all shells, and compare to cat /etc/shells. Change your login shell
to the Korn shell, log out and back in. Now change back to bash.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux: chsh -l
On Debian/Ubuntu: cat /etc/shells

14. Which useradd option allows you to name a home directory ?

-d

15. How can you see whether the password of user harry is locked or unlocked ? Give a solution with grep and a solution with passwd.

grep harry /etc/shadow
passwd -S harry
16. Create the groups tennis, football and sports.
